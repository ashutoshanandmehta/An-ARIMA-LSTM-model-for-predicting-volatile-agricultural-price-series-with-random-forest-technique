# An ARIMA-LSTM model for predicting volatile agricultural price series with random forest technique

This repository contains predictive models for crop prices, focusing on **Arhar**, **Gram**, and **Moong**. 
The models use a combination of time-series analysis and machine learning techniques, including ARIMA, SARIMA, 
and ARIMA-LSTM hybrid models, to forecast future prices based on historical data from **01/2014 to 09/2024**.
